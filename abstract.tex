The project ``Student Information System" is to be used in a department to maintain the records of the students easily, Achieving this objective is difficult using a manual system as the information is scattered, can be redundant and collecting the relevant information may be very time-consuming. All these problems are solved using this project. The project has been thought about from a student point of view and revolves around the usual requirements for a student studying at an engineering level.

The objective of this project is making an interactive user-friendly website which makes the registration of students, teachers and their modification, deletion in an effective, easy way. Every entity can be easily searched according to their name. We have implemented the idea by making a web application that includes table visualization. Any staff using the website will be able to insert all the details, update and delete them when needed. The UI has been made very simple to provide ease of access for all types of users.

This project requires HTML, CSS in the frontend, Python for backend and database connectivity and SQLite for database management. We seek to expand the project by having a fully real-life model of the department in the college.
