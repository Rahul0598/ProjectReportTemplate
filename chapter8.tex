\section{Conclusion}
The Student Information System has been designed to maintain the records of all the aspects of students with respect to college life.\\[0.1in] 

Its project was designed to model the working of an educational institution. It also contains the details about the teachers that work in the college, the courses and subject information are also saved in the database. The database system project includes triggers that allow the user to get the average of attendance and marks every time those values are modified. It also includes a stored procedure to calculate the total average in the attendance table.\\[0.1in]

The project provides simple retrieval techniques and easy updating and deletion operations thus helping inefficient maintenance of records.

\section{Future Enhancements}
Just like any other developer this project is the most basic website built using simple tools. We seek to increase the dynamic of the project by adding various other innovations to it. Such innovations would seem possible only with time, which we lack but regardless we strive to complete what we started.\\[0.1in]

We believe that apart from the present functionalities we can add :

“HOBBIES” which will store the hobbies and extra co-curricular activities of the students.

“CONCURRENT PURCHASE” feature through which two teachers can log in and make changes at the same time.


“STUDENT LOGIN” so that each student may give his/her input on each teacher and subject. This can help in giving appreciation to the teacher for their hard  work and the areas in which they can improve.\\[0.1in]


Apart from these changes we are open to various suggestions and hope to implement them soon so that this website can be used by the students for their needs.
